## Introduction

Lately, I’ve been thinking: How can I write about phishing in a way that stands out? There are already thousands of articles explaining what phishing is, why it’s important, and all that technical stuff. But here’s the issue: when you show these articles to people who aren’t very tech-savvy—those who just want to use their email and Office tools—it doesn’t really grab their attention. Especially when the articles start throwing in terms that even some of us engineers have to Google.

So, how do I explain phishing to someone like Victor? Victor is the new guy in Human Resources at my imaginary company. He’s not super into tech, but he needs to know how to spot and report cyberattacks, or at least avoid falling into traps.

Maybe the answer lies in the term itself—phishing. It’s perfect because it already gives you a hint. Just like in real-life fishing, there’s bait, a hook, and a catch. And trust me, once you understand the basics of digital fishing, you’ll be well on your way to swimming safely through the internet.

## So, What is Phishing?
Let’s break it down. Imagine the internet as a giant sea—there are millions and millions of fish swimming around, and the fishermen are the cybercriminals. These “fishers” (aka hackers) throw out their fishing lines, not to catch actual fish, but to trick people into giving up their personal information.

In this case, the fish are people like you and me—everyday users of the internet. There are tons of us, and we all have different levels of awareness. Some of us are clever dolphins, swiftly dodging danger. Others might be less aware, like curious sardines that could easily be tempted by some tasty-looking bait.

Now, what’s the bait? It could be anything from an email that looks like it’s from your boss, urging you to take immediate action, to a fake website that promises you’ve won a big prize. But no matter what form the bait takes, the goal is the same—to get you to bite and give away your valuable information.

## Why Do I Need to Know About Phishing?
You might be thinking, “I don’t have access to sensitive information. I’m not the IT guy. Why should I care?” But the truth is, every fish in the sea matters. Here’s why you should care about phishing, even if you’re not holding the keys to the company vault:

- #### You’re Part of the Net
Even if you’re not guarding the treasure chest, you’re still part of the company’s defenses. Phishers often target employees who don’t think they’re important. If you fall for their trick, it’s like opening a small hole in the company’s protective net. Once they’re in, they can swim through and wreak havoc on the whole system.

- #### It’s Not Just About Work—It’s Personal
Phishing attacks don’t only happen in the workplace. They can show up in your personal email, on your social media, or even in a text message. Learning how to avoid phishing at work can also help you protect your personal life, from your bank accounts to your social media and online shopping.

- #### The Ripple Effect Can Be Expensive
Even if it seems like “just one click,” the damage from phishing can spread like ripples in a pond. Falling for a phishing scam could lead to stolen identities, financial loss, or even legal trouble for your company. Knowing how to spot phishing scams isn’t just about keeping yourself safe—it’s about protecting the entire team.

## But I Don’t Have an Admin Password—Why Should I Care?
It’s easy to think, “Well, I don’t have any high-level access, so I’m not really a target for hackers.” But that’s exactly what the fishermen want you to think. Here’s why you should still be on guard:

- #### You’re the First Catch
Hackers often go after the easiest fish to catch first. If you’re not careful, you could be their entry point into the company’s network. Just because you don’t have the big key to the castle doesn’t mean your account isn’t valuable. Once they’ve reeled you in, they can swim deeper into the company’s systems.

- #### Your Credentials Are Like Bait
Even if you don’t have admin access, your username and password can be valuable to a hacker. They could use your login to impersonate you, sending more phishing emails to your colleagues or gaining access to internal systems. Think of it like a fisherman using a small fish as bait to catch bigger ones.

- #### Lateral Movement—Swimming Through the Company Waters
Once hackers have hooked one fish (maybe you!), they use a tactic called lateral movement to swim around inside the company. Imagine a burglar sneaking in through an open window and then creeping through the house, unlocking doors and causing more trouble. Even if you don’t hold the biggest keys, falling for phishing could let them move around unnoticed, gaining access to more valuable data.

- #### One Click Can Sink the Ship
A single click on the wrong link can be like a hole in the bottom of a boat—before you know it, the whole thing is sinking. Phishing can spread malware across the company’s network, affecting everyone’s systems and data. It’s not just about you; it’s about the whole team.

## How to Stay Safe From Phishing Scams
Now that you know why it’s so important to recognize phishing, how can you protect yourself? Here are a few fishing tips to keep you from biting the wrong hook:

- #### Don’t Take the Bait
Phishing emails love to create a sense of urgency. They’ll say things like “Your account will be closed in 24 hours!” or “Immediate action required!” If you feel pressured by an email, stop and think. Real companies won’t rush you like this. Take a breath, and verify if it’s legitimate.

- #### Check the Line Before You Bite
Before clicking any links, hover over them to see where they’re really taking you. Just like checking your fishing line to make sure it’s not tangled, checking the link can help you avoid a mess. If the URL looks weird or doesn’t match the company’s website, it’s probably a phishing attempt.

- #### Report the Fishy Business
If something feels off, report it. Send that suspicious email to your IT or security team. It’s better to reel in a false alarm than to let a phisher get away with the catch of the day. Reporting early helps protect the whole company.

## In Conclusion: Don’t Get Hooked!
Just like in real fishing, phishers are out there trying to catch something valuable—and that something is your information. Even if you don’t hold the keys to the company’s most sensitive data, you’re still a part of the network, and your account matters. Whether you’re a sardine just learning to swim safely in the digital waters or a dolphin with experience, we’re all in the same sea, trying to avoid getting caught on the wrong hook.

So, remember to keep an eye out for the bait and always think before you click. Stay safe, and keep swimming!
